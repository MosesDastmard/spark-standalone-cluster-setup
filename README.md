Setting up Apache Spark cluster in standalone mode is a bit tricky. Here I share with you how to setup.

### Linux
I assume that you are familiar with Linux OS and some basic commands (I don't recommend to setup Spark on Windows)

### Requirments
 - At least two machines connecting to same local network. To play around, you may install Linux ([Ubuntu 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)) on virtual machine ([VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads) recommended)
 - Download [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)

### Install VirtualBox
